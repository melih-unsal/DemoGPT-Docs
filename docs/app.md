# Streamlit Application Documentation

## Introduction

This Python Streamlit application uses `LogicModel` and `StreamlitModel` from the `model` module to generate and execute Python code based on user input. The user can input their idea, and the application will generate code, refine it, test it, and display the results. The Streamlit web app allows users to interact with the model in real time, which is particularly useful for demonstrating the capabilities of the models.

## Application Flow

### Importing Dependencies

At the beginning of the application, all necessary modules such as `streamlit`, `model`, `os`, `logging`, `webbrowser`, and `signal` are imported. The logging level is set to DEBUG with the format 'levelname-message'.

### Loading Environment Variables

The application tries to load environment variables using the `dotenv` module. If the module is not present, it logs an error message but continues to execute the application.

### Generate Response

The function `generate_response` uses the `LogicModel` to generate responses for the given text. It's a generator function yielding the output of the `LogicModel` in each iteration.

### Streamlit Configuration

The title of the Streamlit page is set using `st.set_page_config`.

### Input Fields

Input fields for the OpenAI API Key, demo title, and demo idea are created using `st.sidebar.text_input`, `st.text_input`, and `st.text_area` respectively. The OpenAI API Key defaults to the value of the environment variable 'OPENAI_API_KEY'.

### Submission Form

A form is created to handle the submission of user input. If the user submits the form, the application checks if a valid OpenAI API Key is entered. If not, it displays a warning message.

If the input is valid, instances of `LogicModel` and `StreamlitModel` are created with the provided OpenAI API Key.

### Running the Model

The application then enters a loop where it generates, refines, tests and executes code using the `LogicModel`. The progress of this process is displayed on a Streamlit progress bar.

If the code execution is successful, it launches a new Streamlit application running the generated code and opens the new application in the web browser.

In case the execution was not successful, the application refines the code and retries. If all attempts are unsuccessful, it reports a failure.
